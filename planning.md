## Architecture

###### Administrator - Cook express lady

**version-1**

 We will be building our web app with MERN stack. React will be of main use. The features in the app will be : 
 
 1. The lady will take the orders of each customer and it will be each stored by a unique id(eg. - name of customer). With this orders, the dish will be prepared and served with the names called. This way, it will be helpful as there is no need to remember which all dish is to be served to which customer.
 
 2. When the particular customer is done, the lady will have to check the list of that particuar customer. When checking, it will take her to the billing system where all the particular customer dishes price will be calculated.
 
 3. The app will also allow online payment system for the customer.
 
 4. The app will also store the data of the net profit it gained in a particular day and also in a month(have to think about this).
